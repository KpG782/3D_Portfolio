## 📦 Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3d-developer-portfolio.git

# 2. Navigate into the project
cd 3d-developer-portfolio

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

## 🧹 ESLint Configuration

This setup includes a basic ESLint configuration for React development using Vite.  
It ensures code quality, consistent styling, and helps catch potential bugs early.

If you're planning to migrate to TypeScript, consider integrating the following:

- [typescript-eslint](https://typescript-eslint.io) – Enables type-aware linting in TypeScript projects
- [Vite's React TS Template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) – A great starting point for React + TypeScript development
